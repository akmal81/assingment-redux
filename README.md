<!-- # React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

```js
export default tseslint.config([
  globalIgnores(['dist']),
  {
    files: ['**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
    extends: [
      // Other configs...

      // Remove tseslint.configs.recommended and replace with this
      ...tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
      // Alternatively, use this for stricter rules
      ...tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,
      // Optionally, add this for stylistic rules
      ...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,

      // Other configs...
    ],
    languageOptions: {
      parserOptions: {
        project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
        tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
      },
      // other options...
    },
  },
])
```

You can also install [eslint-plugin-react-x](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-x) and [eslint-plugin-react-dom](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-dom) for React-specific lint rules:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import reactX from 'eslint-plugin-react-x'
import reactDom from 'eslint-plugin-react-dom'

export default tseslint.config([
  globalIgnores(['dist']),
  {
    files: ['**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
    extends: [
      // Other configs...
      // Enable lint rules for React
      reactX.configs['recommended-typescript'],
      // Enable lint rules for React DOM
      reactDom.configs.recommended,
    ],
    languageOptions: {
      parserOptions: {
        project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
        tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
      },
      // other options...
    },
  },
])

Minimal Library Management System 📚
Project Overview
Develop a minimal library management system using React, Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query), and TypeScript. The system will allow users to view a list of books, perform CRUD operations, borrow books, and view a simple borrow summary—all without authentication, category filters, or payment integration.

The main goal is to build a functional and clean client-side application that interacts with a RESTful API, demonstrating proper state management, UI design, and core functionality.

Features
1. Public Routes 🚀
All pages of this project are accessible without login or authentication. The focus is on essential book and borrowing features only.

2. Book Management 🛠️
Book List Table:
Show all books in a table format.
Columns: Title, Author, Genre, ISBN, Copies, Availability, and Actions. 
#### done

Action Buttons/Icons:

Edit Book: Opens a form with existing book data to edit book info. On submit, updates via API and reflects instantly in UI.

Business logic:
Quantity cannot exceed available copies.
If quantity reaches 0, the book is marked unavailable.

Delete Book: Opens a confirmation dialog before removal. =>use toast

Borrow Book: Opens a simple form to borrow a book.

Add New Book:
Button to open a form for creating a new book.
Fields: Title, Author, Genre, ISBN, Description, Copies, Available (optional, defaults to true).
After creation, redirect to book list and update UI immediately.



3. Borrow Book
Open from “Borrow” button in the book list.
Fields: Quantity (number), Due Date (date).
Business logic:
Quantity cannot exceed available copies.
If quantity reaches 0, the book is marked unavailable.
Submit via API and show success message.
Redirect to borrow summary page.
4. Borrow Summary
Displays a list of books that have been borrowed, along with the total quantity borrowed for each book.
Retrieved from aggregation API.
Columns: Book Title, ISBN, Total Quantity Borrowed.
Landing Page Components
Navbar: Simple navigation bar with links to:
All Books
Add Book
Borrow Summary
Book Table/List/Grid: Display list of books with all core actions.
Footer: Standard footer with site info or credits.
Page List
(You may choose your preferred UI pattern—pages or modals—for these functionalities.)

/books – Displays a list of all books with options to view, edit, delete, and borrow.
/create-book – Form interface to add a new book to the system.
/books/:id – Detailed view of a single book’s information.
/edit-book/:id – Interface to update an existing book’s details.
/borrow/:bookId – Form to borrow a selected book.
/borrow-summary – Displays an aggregated summary of all borrowed books.
UI/UX
Minimalist UI: clean and featureful UI using Tailwind CSS or plain CSS.
User Experience: Easy navigation between pages, clearly labeled buttons, and simple forms.
Responsive: The layout must be fully responsive and adapt seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Backend Requirements (Moduler/MVC Pattern):
Database: Use MongoDB with a schema including:
Books (with attributes like title, author, genre, isbn, description, copies, available)
Borrows (linked to book, quantity, dueDate etc)
Book Management:
Implement CRUD operations for book (create, read, update, delete).
Borrow Management:
Execute CRUD operations for borrow (borrow, summery), ensuring copies levels before borrow are placed.
Error Handling:
Establish consistent, user-friendly error messa.
Additional Changes:
Ensure backend APIs support pagination for book listings and order retrieval.
Add authentication middleware to protect private routes (if needed).
You may use an existing backend that you have developed previously or create a new version by modifying the older one. Make any additional updates if necessary.

Technical Requirements (Frontend + API Integration)
1. API Integration

Consume backend endpoints via RTK Query in the frontend.
All API calls should be typed and organized using Redux Toolkit Query best practices.
2. State Management

Redux Toolkit with RTK Query:
Used for managing all book and borrow-related API calls and states.
Slices (Optional): Use extra slices for UI states if necessary (e.g., modals).
3. Technology Stack

Layer	Technology
Frontend	React + TypeScript
State Management	Redux Toolkit + RTK Query
Backend	Node.js + Express.js
Database	MongoDB + Mongoose
Styling	Tailwind CSS or any basic CSS framework
Submission:
GitHub Repository Link (backend and frontend) with Professional README file
Live Deployment Link (backend and frontend)
